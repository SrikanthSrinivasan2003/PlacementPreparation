1. Amruta can do a piece of work in 20 days. Narmadha is 25% more efficient that Amruta . The number of days taken by Narmadha to complete the work is..

      Solution :
            Amruta Efficiency = 1/20
            25% of 20 = 5
            20 / 5 = 4 
            20 - 4 = 16 days
      Answer : 16 days

2. A can finish a work in 24 days, B in 9 days and c in 12 days. B and C start the work but are forced to leave after 3 days. Remaining work done by A is...

      Solution :
            LCM of 24, 9 & 12 is 72
            A's Efficiency = 3
            B's Efficiency = 8
            C's Efficiency = 6
            B & C completed work after 3 days = 14 * 3 = 42
            Remaining work = 72 - 42 =30
            A completeed in 30 / 3 = 10 
     Answer : 10 days
