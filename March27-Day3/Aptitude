1. Anil and Bhaskar can do a piece of work individually in 12 and 20 days respectively. They work together for 6 days before Anil decides to leave. 
   How many days will it take Bhaskar to complete the work on his own?
    A. 4  B. 14  C. 6  D. 3

    Solution :
              LCM of 12 and 20 = 60
              Anil's Efficency = 5
              Bhaskar's Efficency = 3
              Work completed in 6 days = 48
              Remaining Work = 60 - 48 = 12
              work completed by Bhaskar = 12/3 = 4

    Answer : 4 days

2. Dilip and Samrat can do a piece of work in 16 days and 24 days respectively. Samrat works alone for 15 days and leaves. 
   In how many days can Dilip complete the remaining work?
    A. 8  B. 10  C. 6  D. 7

Solution :
              LCM of 16 and 24 = 48
              Dilip's Efficency = 3
              Samrat's Efficency = 2
              Work completed in 15 days = 30
              Remaining Work = 48 - 30 = 18
              work completed by Dilip = 18/3 = 6

    Answer : 6 days
